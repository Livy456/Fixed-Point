# Fixed-Point
Fixed Point#1
I was tasked to write a relaxation-method function that accepts three arguments:
- python function, that accepts num as input, & returns float as output
- initial guess for fixed-point, x0, a floating-point num
- num of iterations, ùëõ, to perform relaxation method

Fixed Point#2
I was tasked to write a relaxation-method function that accepts four arguments:
- a python function, that accepts num as input, & returns float as output
- initial guess for fixed-point, ùë•0, floating-point num
- tolerance value, positive-valued floating-point num
- max num of iterations that your algorithm is permitted to run
As well as, my function should produce guesses until estimated num is smaller than specified tolerance value, or until the num of guesses produced (including the initial guess) matches or exceeds max num of iterations. And I had to have a minimum of three guesses before I could assess the tolerance.

Both Fixed Point #1 and #2 had to return a list of all the guesses.
